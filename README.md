## Compatibility/Disclaimer
Everything in this repo has been tested. Even so, use these files at your own risk. 
If you decide to have the pcb fabbed, 1.2mm pcb thickness is recommended. Higher thicknesses are still compatible but add height to the case.

- **Status of keycap compatibility**: only keycaps that are <=17.85mm wide and <=18mm deep are supported
- **Status of bottom case**: ~~cutouts are currently only compatible with choc v2 with the exception of the lever keys, which have cutouts that support both choc v1 and v2~~ fully compatible with both choc v1 and v2
