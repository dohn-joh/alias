## Features
- Custom 3D printed keycaps
  - [Lever keycaps](https://github.com/dohn-joh/keycaps)
  - [Low profile DES variant](https://github.com/dohn-joh/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles)
- Choc v1 and v2 compatible hotswap

## Disclaimer and Compatibility
Everything in this repo has been tested. Even so, use these files at your own risk. 

- **Status of keycap compatibility**: only keycaps that are <=17.85mm wide and <=18mm deep are supported
- **Status of bottom case**: cutouts are currently only compatible with choc v2 with the exception of the lever keys, which have cutouts that support both choc v1 and v2

At this time, if more compatibility is desired, you'll need to edit the files. I might make the changes if more people become interested in building.

## Thanks
These people and many more helped make this keyboard possible. Yall are legends.
